when should i use type class?
consume side okay
if author, implement over basic types

type class implementation? just like java (at object implemntation)
proably that object + injection == type class

why not hard wire via imports?
because doesn't control scenarios for types that you didn't cover (only relevant in library author, novel scenarios)


what is scalding/algebird?
what is semigroup?
